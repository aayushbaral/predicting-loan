## Analyzing Loan Information and Night Light Composites in Nigeria: A Bayesian Approach 
### Introduction
Research has proven night light intensities to be a good indicator of prosperity. In this project I am using Bayesian approach to see the difference in means of loan taken by household based on the night light composites of the location where the household is in Nigeria. Further, I used Bayesian Regression to look at if there is a causal relationship between night light intensties and loan taken.

### Dataset
This project uses KIVA's DHS cluster dataset which has information on nightlight composites of the household and loan amount including a lot of other household information. The dataset can be found inside the Kiva Project folder.

### Libraries/Framework Used
- R
- Bolstad package for Bayesian Analysis
- ggplot for visualizations

A detailed report on the project including the knitted html and RMD files are inside of Kiva Project folder. For any feedbacks, email me at aayushbaral@bennington.edu
